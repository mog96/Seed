<h2>Instructions and quiz for understanding</h2>
<p>Please read the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We will present you with different choices. Your choices and those of other participants determine how much you earn.</li>
	<li>In this experiment, we will assign you the role of either a <b>worker</b> or an <b>employer</b>. Another participant will be given the other role.</li>
	<li>For the duration of a game, each employer is matched to one worker at random, and each worker is matched to one employer at random. After one game you will be matched with a different worker or employer.</li>
	<li>You will play multiple games, in each of these games you can earn points. At the end, the computer randomly picks two games. For these games we will pay you what you earned.</li>
	<li>100 points correspond to $4.00.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game consists of five stages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>As an employer, you are given 20 points. As a worker you are given 10 points.</li>
	<li>The employer offers an <b>employment contract</b> to the worker, paying a <b>wage</b> of 10 or 20 points and <b>asking for an effort level</b> (high or low). Sometimes the wage depends on the effort level.</li>
	<li>The worker chooses to <b>accept</b> or <b>reject</b> this offer. If the worker rejects, no wage is paid, but the worker receives 10 points (in addition to the 10 points the worker earned before).</li>
	<li>If the worker accepted the contract, the worker chooses <b>high or low effort</b>.</li>
	<li>The worker gets paid by the employer, but will need to incur the cost of effort. The employer receives a benefit for effort.</li>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>The worker incurs a cost of <b>5 points</b> for high effort. Low effort is costless.</li>
		<li>The employer gets <b>40 points</b> for high effort and <b>10 points</b> for low effort.</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p>So the employer’s earnings are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>if the contract is rejected: 20 points</li>
	<li>if the contract is accepted: 20 points <b>minus</b> the wage <b>plus</b> the benefit from effort</li>
</ul>
<p>And the worker’s earnings are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>if the contract is rejected: 20 points</li>
	<li>if the contract is accepted: 10 points <b>plus</b> the wage <b>minus</b> the cost of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>An example:</b> suppose the employer offers a wage of 10 points, and the worker accepts and chooses low effort.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The employer earns: 20 points minus the wage of 10 points plus 10 points for the benefit of low effort. This equals 20 – 10 + 10 = 20 points.</li>
	<li>The worker earns: 10 points plus the wage of 10 points minus 0 points for the cost of low effort. This equals 10 + 10 – 0 = 20 points.</li>
</ul>
